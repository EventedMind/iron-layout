Iron.Layout
==============================================================================
Dynamic layout with support for rendering dynamic templates into regions.

Iron.Layout is the page rendering engine for Iron.Router. But layouts can also
be used independently for composing UI components. For example, you app might
have a standard dialog box layout and you want to populate templates dynamically
into the dialog box depending upon what kind of dialog it is.
